                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p> Hello, my name is Marie. I am originally from Paris, but I currently live in Zurich 
                    and I am planning to move in London. As a matter of fact, I prefer to live in a English speaking country, 
                    and close to my family<br>
                    I graduated with a health care management master degree in 2015 and I worked in this 
                    field until 2019. I worked in hospital, nursing home, schizophrenic helping structure and intellectual disability helping structure. <br>
                    In 2019, I moved to Switzerland.
                    
                    At that time, computer science was just a hobby, then I tried to improve my skills in JavaScript to transform this passion 
                    into a job. <br>
                    </p>

                <h3>Why am I applying to this programme ?</h3>
                <p>When I began to learn HTML and CSS, it was just by curiosity, but I liked it so I imagined 
                    that I could do my own website. I have a few ideas to develop, but I still miss some skills before
                    being ready to do so. <br>
                    This programme could help me to improve my skills, not to just develop a website, but to be part 
                    of a bigger project by being in a company and then maybe create mine.<br>
                    When I was working in health care, we (the whole health care system) were always struggling with 
                    the software limitations. Today I can see how easy the problems could be resolved and I wonder 
                    how I can help the health care providers. <br>
                    
                </p>
