            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p> Hello, my name is Marie. I am originally from Paris, but I currently live in Zurich 
                and I am planning to move in London. As a matter of fact, I prefer to live in a English speaking country, 
                and close to my family<br>
                I graduated with a health care management master degree in 2015 and I worked in this 
                field until 2019. I worked in hospital, nursing home, schizophrenic helping structure and intellectual disability helping structure. <br>
                In 2019, I moved to Switzerland.
                
                At that time, computer science was just a hobby, then I tried to improve my skills in JavaScript to transform this passion 
                into a job. <br>
                </p>

            <h3>Why am I applying to this programme ?</h3>
            <p>When I began to learn HTML and CSS, it was just by curiosity, but I liked it so I imagined 
                that I could do my own website. I have a few ideas to develop, but I still miss some skills before
                being ready to do so. <br>
                This programme could help me to improve my skills, not to just develop a website, but to be part 
                of a bigger project by being in a company and then maybe create mine.<br>
                When I was working in health care, we (the whole health care system) were always struggling with 
                the software limitations. Today I can see how easy the problems could be resolved and I wonder 
                how I can help the health care providers. <br>
                <br>
